    <h2>About me</h2>
    
    <p>The main reason I decided to go into web developmenet is cause of all the opportunities that it has, along with 
    helping me get to know all kinds of people who I can get along with and help each other in times of need. Besides that,
    I enjoy reading a lot of Stephen King, playing video games, doing some fun activities, outdoor and indoor, and trying
    new things that I have never really done before.</p>
