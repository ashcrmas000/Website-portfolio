        to know at least a few people at wherever I work in order to 
	improve my social skills and improve cooperation with 
        other people.</li>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    
	    <li> The main reason I decided to go into web development is cause of all the
	that it has, along with helping me get to know all kinds of people who I
	can get along with and help each other in times of need. Besides that, I
	enjoy reading a lot of Stephen King, playing video games, doing some fun
	activities with other people, indoor and outdoor, and trying new things
	that I have never really done before.</li>
